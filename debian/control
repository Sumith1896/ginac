Description: The GiNaC framework (runtime library)
 GiNaC (which stands for "GiNaC is Not a CAS (Computer Algebra System)") is a
 library for doing symbolic (i.e. non-numeric) computation directly in the C++
 programming language.

Description: Some tools for the GiNaC framework
 GiNaC (which stands for "GiNaC is Not a CAS (Computer Algebra System)") is a
 library for doing symbolic (i.e. non-numeric) computation directly in the C++
 programming language.
 .
 This package provides some additional tools, like the popular ginsh (GiNaC
 interactive shell) and viewgar (for inspecting GiNaC archive files).  See
 <http://www.ginac.de/> for detailed information about GiNaC.

Description: The GiNaC framework (debugging symbols)
 GiNaC (which stands for "GiNaC is Not a CAS (Computer Algebra System)") is a
 library for doing symbolic (i.e. non-numeric) computation directly in the C++
 programming language.
 .
 This package provides an unstripped shared library with debugging symbols. The
 library is installed in /usr/lib/debug and will be automatically used by
 gdb while debugging programs using the GiNaC library. Most people will not
 need this package. For detailed information about GiNaC see 
 <http://www.ginac.de/>.
