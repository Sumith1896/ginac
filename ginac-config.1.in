is a tool that is used to determine the compiler and linker flags that

.B \-\-cppflags
Print the compiler flags that are necessary to compile a GiNaC program.

.B \-\-prefix=PREFIX
If specified, use PREFIX instead of the installation prefix that GiNaC was
built with when computing the output for the \-\-cppflags and \-\-libs
options. This option is also used for the exec prefix if \-\-exec\-prefix was
not specified. This option must be specified before any \-\-libs or
\-\-cppflags options.
